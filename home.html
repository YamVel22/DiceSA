      <p>The objective of the game is to roll the highest number on the dice. <!--We can still edit the rules depending on how we plan our dice game-->
        <ul id="rules">
          <li>
           The game is played between two players.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players are to take turns rolling the dice.
          </li>
          <li>
            On a player's turn, they roll the dice and the number rolled becomes their score for that round.
          </li>
          <li>
            The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins. 
          </li>
          <li>If the player's score is the same then it is a tie.</li>
